# Coffee-Shop :coffee:

It consists of backend and (modest) frontend parts. 
As a register user you can perform some operations related to menu of fancy coffee shop. You can adjust menu by adding some regular coffee
as well as some cool matcha staff! :tea:

I use Go (1.17), mysql as a db, pat and alice.
